It’s like shake and bake chicken but holy heck, so much better!','<h2>Katsu in Japan</h2><p>Japan has dedicated tonkatsu restaurants that focus on pork cutlets, along with seafood like ebi fry (panko deep fried shrimp) or kaki-fry (panko deep fried oyster). <a href=\"https://iamafoodblog.com/chicken-katsu-sando-crispy-japanese-chicken-sandwich-recipe/\">There are also katsu-sando</a> which are pork cutlet sandwiches. Chicken katsu is not as popular as its pork counterpart in Japan but it’s insanely popular all over the world, probably because it’s very similar to chicken tenders or chicken schnitzel.</p><h2>How to make chicken katsu</h2><ol><li><strong>Prep the chicken cutlets.</strong> Lightly pound the chicken so that it’s about 1/2 inch thick. This helps it cook more evenly. Season both sides with salt and pepper.</li><li><strong>Flour.</strong> Dip the chicken in flour, shaking off any excess.</li><li><strong>Egg.</strong> Dip the chicken in the egg, coating both sides, shaking off the excess.</li><li><strong>Panko.</strong> Press the chicken into the panko, making sure the panko coats all of the chicken.</li><li><strong>Cook.</strong> Air fry, bake, or deep fry the chicken katsu.</li><li><strong>Enjoy!</strong> Slice, serve with rice, cabbage, sauce, and enjoy.</li></ol><h2>What is katsu?</h2><p>Katsu is a Japanese transliterated word, meaning cutlet. It comes from <a href=\"https://iamafoodblog.com/easy-oven-baked-pork-tonkatsu/\">tonkatsu</a> (pictured below), which is a pork cutlet, but there are also all other kinds of katsu, which has turned into a term for panko breaded items.

They sell them at Asian grocery stores or you can buy them online. They’re essentially a wheat noodle with frilly edges that have a wonderfully silky chewy texture that holds up well to sauce. You can use any wide noodle you have in your pantry.</li><li><strong>neutral oil</strong> – we need a bit of oil to cook up the garlic and toast the red pepper flakes so that everything gets amazingly fragrant and delicious.</li><li><strong>garlic</strong> – 6 cloves of garlic because we’re garlic lovers. Feel free to adjust as needed!</li><li><strong>red pepper flakes</strong> – this is what is going to bring the heat. This recipe calls for 1 tsp which is just spicy enough without being overpowering, but that depends on your spice levels. Remember, you can always add spice but you can’t take it away, so start small.</li><li><strong>soy sauce</strong> – umami and saltiness to combine with the tiny bit of sugar we’ll add for a sweet and savory sauce.</li><li><strong>gochujang</strong> – a little bit of gochujang (a spicy Korean sauce) adds savory sweetness and so much flavor. More on gochujang below!</li><li><strong>brown sugar</strong> – just the lightest touch of brown sugar to highlight all the savory and spicy notes.</li></ul><h2>How to make spicy noodles</h2><ol><li><strong>Cook the noodles:</strong> bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the noodles according to the package directions.</li><li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong> While the noodles are cooking, add the oil and heat the garlic and red pepper flakes in a nonstick pan over medium heat, stirring until the garlic is fragrant. Stir in the soy sauce, gochujang, and honey.</li><li><strong>Mix:</strong> Add the noodles to the pan and toss until all the noodles are glossy and coated. Loosen with a bit of noodle water if needed.<br>Enjoy!</li></ol><h2>You call this spicy!??!</h2><p>If these noodles aren’t spicy enough for you, definitely increase the chili pepper flakes and the amount of gochujang you’re using. Also, pro tip, use chili flakes that are fresh, they tend to be spicier. Some specific pepper flakes you can try:</p><ul><li><strong>Gochugaru</strong> – A seedless Korean pepper that’s sweet and mellow with not too much heat.</li><li><strong>Aleppo chili flakes</strong> – fruity and earthy with a bit of heat and a touch of cumin.</li><li><strong>Guajillo chili flakes</strong> – very earthy and more heat!</li><li><strong>Sichuan chili flakes</strong> – spicy but not too spicy unless you use a huge amount.

Vertical spits are often associated with middle eastern food and this is no exception: legend says that Lebanese immigrants brought the cooking method to Mexico, where they paired it with traditional adobada to make the genius known as al pastor.</p><p>It’s served in all kinds of dishes, in tortas/sandwiches, pizzas, and even on rice, but the most celebrated way to serve it is in tacos al pastor. The crisp smoky pork is sliced-to-order with a razor sharp knife as it’s flame crisped by the vertical spit. The meat falls right into each taco and topped with a flourish of slow-roasted pineapple.

It bakes up in just a minute in the microwave and is a warm and chocolate-y treat that will satisfy any chocolate sweet tooth.

Let cool slightly, then enjoy!</p><h2>Toaster oven mug cake</h2><p>If you don’t have a microwave and want to bake your cake, you can do so in a preheated 350°F toaster oven or oven. Heat the oven, then make the cake as per the recipe. Bake for 20-25 minutes, depending on how gooey you want your cake to be. If you want a perfectly cooked cake, use a toothpick and insert it in the middle. When the toothpick comes out clean, the cake is done.</p><h2>What does it taste like?</h2><p>Heaven! Seriously, I’m not joking guys, this cake is SO GOOD. It’s moist, chocolatey, and light and fluffy. I love the melty chocolate parts that essentially make it like molten chocolate lava cake. I like it plain, with a little bit of powdered sugar, with whipped cream, with ice cream, oh my gosh, I feel like I need one right now. The best part is that it comes together so quickly. Bonus points for the fact that I almost always have everything right at home.</p><h2>Mug cake ingredients</h2><p>For this mug cake, you need:</p><p><strong>AD</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Milk.</strong> I use whatever milk I have in the fridge, usually 2% or almond.</li><li><strong>Oil.</strong> Try to use a neutral oil that doesn’t have any flavor like canola oil.</li><li><strong>Flour.</strong></li><li><strong>Cocoa powder.</strong> For cocoa powder, we need the unsweetened kind, not hot chocolate milk.</li><li><strong>Baking powder.</strong></li><li><strong>Sugar.</strong> You can adjust the sugar to you liking, or use a sugar alternative.</li><li><strong>Chocolate chips.</strong> The chocolate gets melty and gooey and is the best part! I usually just chop up a bit of a chocolate bar/baking chocolate if I don’t have chocolate chips in the pantry.</li></ul>',_binary '\0',1,5,'2023-03-04 00:00:00','2023-03-04 00:00:00'),(6,'Tokyo Food Guide','1677967519547.jpg','Where and What to Eat in Tokyo','<p>So, you’re planning on going to Tokyo? You’ve found the <a href=\"https://www.5dayguides.com/asia/japan/5-days-in-tokyo/\">best place to stay in Tokyo</a> and now you want to find some great food places. First off, congrats! I’m so jealous. Tokyo is one of my all time favorite cities. There is so much to do, so much to see, and most importantly, so much to eat. Check out a <a href=\"https://upgradedpoints.com/tokyo-travel-guide\">Tokyo city guide</a> before you go to make sure you don’t miss out on any cool things to do. Tokyo has it all, from hole in the wall gyoza places to high-end Michelin sushi bars. If you’re planning on going to Tokyo and are staying in something like these <a href=\"https://www.treksplorer.com/best-hotels-near-shinjuku-station-tokyo/\">hotels in Shinjuku</a>, plan on eating, because eating is half the fun. <i>Warning: this is a LONG post!</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A quick note on planning: keep your expectations low. I don’t mean that the food is going to be bad – quite the opposite in fact: the food is going to blow your mind. It’s the expectation that you’ll be able to find the places that you want to eat at that most likely won’t be met. The addresses in Tokyo are very, very peculiar. Don’t forget to look up if you’re looking for a restaurant. Many times they’re tucked away on the second floor or higher. Not everything’s at street level. In fact, I’d say that a large majority of places aren’t. Google Maps helps if you have internet. And if you don’t, most people are friendly enough to help you out, as long as they’re not in the middle of something.</p><p>With all that said, here are some of Mike and my favorite places in Tokyo. I can’t believe it’s been three months since we moved back and I’m only now getting around to making a list of my must eats. A quick caveat: this is by no means an exhaustive list – I left out lots of places that are delicious. It’s always fun to wander around and just pick a random joint, so I definitely recommend that.</p><p>Pro tip: If you want lots of variety (which is something many foreigners complain about because most restaurants are single dish oriented. If they specialize in katsu, you’re only getting katsu so good luck if someone in your party doesn’t like katsu when you’re at the katsu place) head to a depachika, the basement floor of any good department store. There’s a massive amount of take-out food that is affordable and delicious. The only issue is, there don’t have any where to sit. But, if you take your food upstairs, most department stores have a rooftop garden or seating area.</p>',_binary '\0',6,2,'2023-03-04 00:00:00','2023-03-04 00:00:00'),(7,'Iceland: The Ring Road','1677968687425.jpg','We landed at night and after a quick pause to pick up our trusty rental car, we drove to our first stop, not too far from the airport in Reykjavik.
